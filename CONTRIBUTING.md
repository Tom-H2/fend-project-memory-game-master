# How to contribute

The files in this repository are used as the starting point for all students. Because we want students to write the majority of the code themselves, pull requests (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.

The final code for the Matching Game was written by Tom Harris. The code that shuffles the deck of cards I wrote following Matthew Cranford's tutorial that he posted on the Grow with Google FEND Slack channel. This project represents six weeks worth of work on my part and would never have been finished without the help of countless cohort mates from the Udacity FEND course.
